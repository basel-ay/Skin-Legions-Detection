What is a dermatofibroma ?
A dermatofibroma is a common benign fibrous nodule usually found on the skin of the lower legs.
A dermatofibroma is also called a cutaneous fibrous histiocytoma.



Who gets a dermatofibroma ?
Dermatofibromas are mostly seen in adults. People of every ethnicity can develop dermatofibromas. Ordinary dermatofibromas are more common in women than in men, although some histologic variants are more commonly identified in males.


What causes dermatofibroma ?
It is not clear if dermatofibroma is a reactive process or a true neoplasm. The lesions are composed of proliferating fibroblasts. Histiocytes may also be involved.
They are sometimes attributed to minor trauma including insect bites, injections, or a rose thorn injury, but not consistently. Multiple dermatofibromas can develop in patients with altered immunity such as HIV, immunosuppression, or autoimmune conditions.
