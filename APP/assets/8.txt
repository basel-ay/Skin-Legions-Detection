What is it ? 
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are abnormal, uncontrolled growths that arise from the skinâ€™s basal cells in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis).


Where is it usually found ? 
These cancers most often develop on skin areas typically exposed to the sun, especially the face, ears, neck, scalp, shoulders and back.


What causes it ? 
Most BCCs are caused by the combination of intermittent, intense exposure and cumulative, long-term exposure to UV radiation from the sun.


How many people get it ? 
BCC is the most common form of skin cancer, with approximately 3.6 million cases diagnosed in the United States each year.


How serious is it ? 
BCCs can be locally destructive if not detected and treated early. Occasionally these cancers metastasize (spread); and in very rare instances they can be fatal.
